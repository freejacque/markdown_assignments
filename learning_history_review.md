#Reviewing My Learning History

**What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you as a learner during WDI?**
changed

I have the habit of wanting to figure everything out for myself. I think that could make the collaborative nature of our program a bit difficult to get used to.

**How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?**

I will have to be mindful and realize when I am struggling in my mind and make an extra effort to move out of my comfort zone to ask for help.


**What learning tactics or approaches do you feel have most benefitted you as a student?**

I tend to learn best when I can see an example and can try to duplicate it on my own. I have also made great use of flash cards in my educational career.

**Can you think of any strategies to increase the output or viability of these approaches in the context of WDI? (No idea is too crazy.)**

To benefit from learning by example, we could have small exercises interspersed throughout our lectures.

**What is your greatest fear as a WDI student?**

My greatest fear is that I won't understand a lot of the material. Then after the program is finished I will be in a lot of debt and unable to get a job in web development.

**Is this fear valid? If so, does it serve you as someone learning to program?**

I think it is a valid concern. It can serve as motivation to do well. I'll also try not to let my fear be a hinderance and additional source of stress.
